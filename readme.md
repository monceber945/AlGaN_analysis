# Goals and means

Shubnikov de Haas oscillations analysis is very common in quantum transport measurements. I want to create a script/module that would help me or people from my group to save a lot of time and manual work.

### Ideas
- different materials could be a different branches of code at first. I will somehow merge it together and implement some exteral parameters that would unify the code and make the functions more universal
- for now it is a jupyter notebook with all definitions inside. i think that it would be cool to transfer it to a importable module and leave the jupyter notebook as an example
